#### Senior Front-end Developer
* Amsterdam Area, Netherlands
* Since October 2013, to date.
I develop several websites for Heineken brands. I fixed bugs and added shared modules (Multimedia Gallery) to various Heineken websites. My main focus is to make responsive layouts that work for both desktop browsers, tablets and smartphones. I try to reach as high a test coverage percentage, given a project's budget.

More recently I've been moving to React.js, after using Angular.js. I'm increasingly developing rich front-end web apps for backend web APIs. I've switched to ES6 (or ES2015) with webpack and babel.js
